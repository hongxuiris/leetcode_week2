# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

# We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
# I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
# Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

# You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
# -1 : My number is lower
# 1 : My number is higher
# 0 : Congrats! You got it!

# Example :
# Input: n = 10, pick = 6
# Output: 6


# time complexity o(logn)
# space complexity o(1)
